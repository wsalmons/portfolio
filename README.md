## Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice job on Milestone 1. Your goals and persona could both have a little more detail on them, but they are clearly connected to each other and still get your point across. What kind of company does this guy work for? Is he design focused, or looking for back-end ability, or maybe breadth of skills? Answering questions like these will help guide the actual design and planning of your PWP so it's less of a shot in the dark, so try to think of what your goals are and how that would be reflected in a persona of someone looking at your site. You may not know all these answers yet, but it's helpful to consider.

Your HTML looks really great and is very organized and easy to read. You probably noticed this, but keep in mind that new lines in your HTML don't necessarily translate to new lines on the page, and when coding you want to balance what is readable with what is sustainable to write. Your code is clean enough that it definitely speaks for itself and I don't think you need to go the extra step.

For your .gitignore, make sure you have a . in front of the file name so it's recognized as the correct file by git. A dot means it's a 'hidden' file or directory, hidden from normal file lists. Also the idea directory should be /.idea since it's a directory with the name '.idea'.

Overall great work on your milestone, which passes at a Tier III!

## Milestone 2a Feedback
Some good work with your wireframes. The content strategy lacks a little bit in terms of detail but overall it will help you through your development phase. 

First thing to note is that your staggered layout on mobile. I would suggest stacking these items on the smaller screens to ensure there is enough space to comfortably read the text - the horizontal space might get too narrow, so stagger only on screen sizes that can accomodate it well. Due to the simplicity of your site, I would also suggest finding a good color scheme and a good font to balance out amount of content you have for your PWP.

We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no frontend-facing site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Remember use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory for now!
